        <p class="two">
            <strong>Canvas </strong> <br>
            With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. <br>
            <strong>Why not set width and height using CSS? </strong> <br>
          You may be asking yourself, why not set the width and height via CSS? It’s because the width and height attributes determine how large the canvas
           coordinate system is. If we don't specify width and height, the canvas element will default to a width of 300 and a height of 150. If we set the
            width and height for a canvas only in CSS, the canvas element will be 300 by 150, and the CSS properties will simply determine how large the box 
            is that displays the image. <br>
          <strong>What about 3D?</strong> <br>
          WebGL is a new API for 3D graphics being managed by the Khronos Group, with
          a WebGL working group that includes Apple, Mozilla, Google, and Opera. <br>
          <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
          Drawing a Rectangle to the Canvas <br>
          var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); <br>
          var context = canvas.getContext("2d"); <br>
          context.strokeStyle = "red";<br>
          context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)"; <br>
          context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);<br>
          context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100); <br>
          
          <strong>SVG</strong> <br>
          Stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector
          graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them 
          up or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns. <br>
          <strong>Example</strong> <br>
                 Drawing in SVG <br>
                 Drawing a circle in SVG is arguably easier than drawing a circle with canvas. Here’s
                 how we do it: <br>
                 svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400"><br>
                circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red"/ <br>
                <strong>Note</strong> <br>
                There’s also no access to what’s drawn on the canvas via the DOM. Because of this,
                canvas is much faster than SVG the Current State of WAI-ARIA The WAI-ARIA specification is still improving, 
                as is HTML5, so these technologies are yet to provide all the benefits we would like. <br>
                <strong>Microdata</strong> <br>
                Microdata is another technology that’s rapidly gaining adoption and support, but, unlike WAI-ARIA, it’s technically part of HTML5. Although still early 
                in development, it’s worth mentioning the Microdata specification here, because the technology provides a peek into what may be the future of document 
                readability and semantics. In the spec, Microdata is defined as a mechanism that “allows machine-readable data to be embedded in HTML documents in an 
                easy-to-write manner, with an unambiguous parsing model.” <br>
