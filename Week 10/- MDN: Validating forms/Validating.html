        <p class="two">
               <strong>Form validation</strong> <br> When you enter data, the web application checks it to see that the data is correct. If the information is correct, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't correct, it gives you an error message explaining what needs to be corrected
                Our applications won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the incorrect format or if they don't enter the correct information or omit information altogether.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are two different types of form validation that you'll encounter on the web: <br>
            -	<strong> Client-side </strong> validation is validation that occurs in the browser before the data has been submitted to the server. <br>
            -	<strong>Server-side</strong> validation is validation that occurs on the server after the data has been submitted. Server-side code is used to validate the data before the data is saved in the database. If the data fails authentication, a response is sent back to the client with corrections that the user needs to make.
