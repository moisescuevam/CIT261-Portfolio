        <h1>Modules</h1>
        <p class="two">
        Modules provide structure to bigger programs by separating the code into pieces with clear <br> interfaces and dependencies.

        The most widely used approach to bolted-on JavaScript modules is <br> called CommonJS modules. Node.js uses it and is the system used by most packages on NPM.

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <h4>Roads module</h4>
        <p class="one">
                // Add dependencies and exports <br>

                const roads = [ <br>
                  "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin", <br>
                  "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall", <br>
                  "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall", <br>
                  "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm", <br>
                  "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm", <br>
